# BAMAZON

An interactive storefront that runs in the console using node. This storefront in no way resembles Amazon, except in name.

#### How It Works

 ## Bamazon (Customer) 

 This part of the app, the customer is displayed the total inventory in a table grid for the customer to make their choice of purchase.  It shows the item id, product name, price and the items that are left in stock.

 Then the client is prompted to pick the item id they would like to purchase and how many of this item they want.  After the client makes his/her selection, Bamamzon will show the the number of items selected and the product name. If the client makes a selection that is not available(not enough inventory), they will be prompted to edit their purchase.  The table grid will be automatically updated to display they new inventory in stock.

 ## Bamazon Manager

 #### How It Works

 This part of the app is designed for a manager of Bamazon to view inventory, add to inventory and to add new products to inventory.  The mamanger is first prompted by a series of choices.  If they choose to view products for sale, they app will display a table grid of all available items for sale.  They can also view low inventory.  This function will show the manager items that only have 10 items left.  If they want, they then can add to inventory by choosing the item id and amount they want to add to inventory.  And finally if they want to add a new product to they inventory, the mamanger has that choice by creating a new product.  This function will add the new product with all perspective information to the bottom of the table grid.
